module runtime;

// _main is a compiler-generated function which essentially represents the
// transition from runtime code to user code.  It contains the code to call all
// non-comptime global initializers and call the user's provided main function.
// The runtime must be in a good state before this function is called.
//
// NOTE: Because `_main` is responsible for calling non-comptime global
// initializers, runtime code called before initialization must NOT use global
// initializers which cannot be evaluated at compile-time: we are reliant on the
// compiler putting comptime initializers in `.data` (or `.rodata`) and not
// generating initialization code for them.  Otherwise, we could end up in a
// situation where calling `_main` overwrites runtime state in an undesirable
// way.  All this is to say: don't use non-comptime global initializers in the
// runtime, or bad things may happen.
