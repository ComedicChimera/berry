# The Berry Programming Language

Berry is small, compiled programming language.  I have been developing it
primarily for my own enjoyment and challenge over the past few weeks.  As of
now, it is already Turing complete, but I have not yet implemented support for
any platforms other than Windows (the one I work on).

I am first and foremost a full-time college student and research assistant, so I
don't always get time (or energy) to work on it.

## Roadmap 

- [x] Target 1: Hello World

- [x] Target 2: Conditionals, Loops, and Arithmetic

- [x] Target 3: Arrays and Strings

- [x] Target 4: Modules and Multi-File Projects

- [ ] Target 5: Structs

- [ ] Target 6: Enums, Aliases, and Basic Match Statements

- [ ] Target 7: Non-Numeric Equality

- [ ] Target 8: Meta Directives and Intrinsic Macros

- [ ] Target 9: Constants, Comptimes, and Global Initializers
    * Init Ordering and Cycle Detection
    * Comptime Expressions removed from `__$init`
    * Runtime Globals won't be overwritten by `runtime.__$init`

- [ ] Target 10: Dynamic Memory, Threads, and Panicking

- [ ] Target 11: Garbage Collections and Automatic Allocation
