# The Berry Programming Language

Berry is small, compiled programming language.  I have been developing it
primarily for my own enjoyment and challenge over the past few weeks.  As of
now, it is already Turing complete, but I have not yet implemented support for
any platforms other than Windows (the one I work on).

I am first and foremost a full-time college student and research assistant, so I
don't always get time (or energy) to work on it.
